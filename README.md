"I Make dropshiper's job easier" ~ shopee inventory bot [Watch video demo](https://github.com/koleksirobot/shopee-inventory-bot/)

The idea inspired by my wife daily life as a dropshippers. In order to keep her store stock up-to-date, she did manual update for stocks from the suppliers store in shopee and it was quite exhausting because the more the items, the longer it takes to update them all. So as a loving husband, I came up with this simple idea to make her job easier. 

The bot tasks are quite simple. Just type /update_stock_store on Telegram message and all of the stock on the spreadsheets will be updated automaticaly. After that she just need to download the updated spreadsheet and upload it using [shopee mass updater](https://seller.shopee.co.id/edu/article/100)
